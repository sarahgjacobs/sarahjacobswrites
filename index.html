                    trying a new hobby, going for a run, taking a nap, or programming this website. Stay tuned to see

                            The Flat Shores was a notoriously dark land for the worst of the criminals to live
                            locked
                            away forever,
                            but Kel isn't one of the criminals--her parents were before they died. The only way for
                            her
                            to escape her cruel upbringing
                            was to recieve a pass from a Consul, one of the few highly qualified fighters of the
                            land. But it isn't every day such an esteemed fighter dares to walk into the Flat
                            Shores.<br>
                            Evil arrives one morning with intentions to gather as many abled bodies as it can, and
                            Kel
                            happens to be swept up into his palm. Greedy for loyal soldies, Synth uses his charisma
                            to
                            win over the children like Kel, children that inherited the strength of their parents
                            but
                            had no formal training in order to weild it. Knowing her fate was beginning to darken
                            under
                            Synth's training, Kel escapes
                            with her quick wits and the trust of a local Headmaster. Unable to help her more than
                            that,
                            the
                            Headmaster sends her to Hollowfall where one of Reforia's top six Consuls, Keystone, has
                            an
                            entire organization of spys set up in order to gether intellegence on Synth. Keystone is
                            a
                            man of little faith or sympathy for his students, escpecially toward Kel who is
                            stubborn,
                            hot headed, and worst of all, connected to Synth. <br>
                            Under Keystone's tough regimen, Kel will
                            be
                            tested to the edge of her abilities until it's finally time for Synth to return to claim
                            what's his. History will unfold once again as they states come head to head. Will
                            Keystone
                            trust Kel enough, will her strength fail her, or will death find
                            them all first?

                                programmers who caused her father's accident. <br> As Meili struggles to follow each
                                meticulous law of the programming world, news of an underground group of hackers
                                famously known as The Circuit bend the laws in order to shatter harmful companies,
                                incriminate enemies on the loose, and go where no other programmer can reach

                                dangerous opponent enters the game, and he has eyes for Meili's skills as well.
                                <br>Peter Glascow, long time best friend and rival of Meili Hane's father, is
